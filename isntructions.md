We're making a simple email signup page for a local tech group.

The page will have a form with an email field and a submit button. When the form is submitted, the email will be added to a list and the user will see a success message. If the email is invalid, the user will see an error message.

We're using Next.js, Shadcn, TailwindCSS, with pnpm as our package manager. We will will host this on Vercel.
